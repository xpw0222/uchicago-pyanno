pyAnno 2.0
=====================================================

pyAnno 2.0 is a Python library for the analysis and
diagnostic testing of annotation and curation
efforts. pyAnno implements statistical models for
inferring from categorical data annotated by multiple
annotators

    * annotator accuracies and biases,
    * gold standard categories of items,
    * prevalence of categories in population, and
    * population distribution of annotator accuracies
      and biases.

The models include a generalization of Dawid and
Skene's (1979) multinomial model with Dirichlet
priors on prevalence and  estimator accuracy, and
the two models introduces in Rzhetsky et al.'s (2009).
The implementation allows Maximum Likelihood and
Maximum A Posteriori estimation of parameters,
and to draw samples from the full posterior
distribution over annotator accuracy.
